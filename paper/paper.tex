\begin{abstract}
We introduce BoostEM, a semi-supervised learning algorithm which combines the benefits of using an ensemble method like Boosting with the benefits of using unlabeled data.  BoostEM is intended for use in learning settings with an abundance of unlabeled data, and outperforms the traditional AdaBoost algorithm and learning with fractional data from using Expectation Maximization across a variety of base learners and data sets.

\section{Introduction}

It is well established in Machine Learning that labels are difficult to obtain while unlabeled data are abundant in many situations where we would like to classify new instances. Examples of such situations are labeling x-rays as benign or malignant, tweets as instances of bullying, news articles as interesting to a given reader, or whether a photograph contains a given object. Because of this scarcity of labeled instances, using semi-supervised learning techniques, such as Expectation Maximization, to combine unlabeled and labeled data into an integrated model is a good idea to potentially improve learner accuracy and reduce human labour.

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a semi-supervised learning algorithm, BoostEM, which combines the benefits of an ensemble method like Boosting with the benefits of using unlabeled data. The next section provides an overview of related work on Boosting and Expectation Maximization. This section is followed by the details of the BoostEM algorithm and an experimental evaluation of our implementation. We then present the results of our evaluation and discuss our findings and their implications.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Boost}

~\cite{Freund:1997:DGO:261540.261549}

\subsection{Expectation Maximization}
Expectation is an iterative algorithm which uses the values of existing,complete data points to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for missing values for other, incomplete data. Expectation Maximization was originally introduced in ~\cite{Dempster77maximumlikelihood} and produces a probabalistic distribution of the possible values of missing data given fully labeled data. In the context of semi-supervised learning, there is a set of labeled input data and a potentially much larger set of unlabeled data and for each unlabeled instance u, EM can provide a probability for each label.  These probabilities can be used as fractional instances of labeled data, making the input training set much bigger and diverse and potentially giving a better approximation of the distribution of labels to the learner. In many cases, performance can be drastically improved by using these fractional counts.

Expectation maximization is a general approach and can be augmented to suite a variety of settings and assumptions.  For instance, in our implementation of BoostEM we assume the data is well modeled by a Gaussian mixture model and the instances have weights associated with them.    

     
\section{Related Work}
\section{BoostEM}
The main insight of BoostEM is observing that Boost and Expectation Maximization both attempt to improve the current iteration's results by using information from the previous iteration; BoostEM simply couples the results of the two algorithms together to improve results.  BoostEM uses a weighted EM algorithm, and these weights are identical to the weights used in the Boost algorithm.  At it's most basic level, BoostEM simply runs a weighted Expectation Maximization on the unlabeled instances, and uses the fractional counts to create a weighted training set for some base learner.  The results of this base learner are then used to update the weights, which are then input to EM in the next iteration.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{BoostEM}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{BoostEM}{$L,U,H,T$}
\State L=Labeled Data
\State U=Unlabeled Data
\State H=Learner
\State T=Number of Boost iterations

\State for $i \in |L|$, $ Wl(i) \gets 1$
\State for $i \in |U|$, $ Wu(i) \gets 1$

\For{$t=1 \dots T$}
\State Normalize $Wu,Wl$
\State get fractional counts $P_{t} \gets EM(L,U,Wl,Wu)$
\State $H_{t} \gets \text{model learned from L, fractional counts of U}$
\State $\epsilon_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{|L|} Wl_{i}(1-\delta(h_{t}(L_{i}),y_{i}))$
\State $\epsilon_{t} += \sum_{i=1}^{|U|} Wu_{i}(1-\delta(h_{t}(L_{i}),{P_{t,}}_{h_{t}(L_{i})}))$
\State if $|U| > 0$ then $\epsilon /= 2$
\State $\beta_{t} \gets \frac{\epsilon_{t}}{1-\epsilon_{t}}$
\State for $i,h_{t}(L_{i} = y_{i}) \in |L| Wl(i) \gets Wl(i)*\beta_{t}$
\State for $i \in |U|$, $Wl(i) \gets Wu(i)*\beta_{t}$

\EndFor
\State \textbf{return} $\arg \max_{y} \sum_{i=1}^{T}\bigg(\log(\frac{1}{\beta_{t}}\bigg) \delta(\bf{x},y)$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

By using a weighted EM, we can place more emphasis on the instances our learner incorrectly classifies in the Gaussian distribution of instances we assume. Or more correctly, since there is no ground truth to the unlabeled instances, we can penalize every prediction from learner $H$ on unlabeled instance $x$ by $1-p(H(x))$, where $p(\dot)$ is the distribution of labels from EM.  In this way, the learner penalizes unexpected labels (ones with small probability) more than expected ones.

Notice as well that using Expectation Maximization for fractional counts and adaBoost can be recovered from BoostEM by setting certain inputs and parameters.  Setting the number of boosting iterations to 1 is equivalent to EM, while inputting no unlabeled instances reduces to traditional labeled Boosting.    
    
\section{Evaluation}
We implemented the BoostEM algorithm in \textsc{python} and evaluated its accuracy against a number of other algorithms using two learners and a variety of parameter settings  as described below.

\subsection{Data sets}

We evaluated the performance of our algorithm on four data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic), which classifies digitized images of breast mass as benign or malignant; Parkinsons, which classifies biomedical voice measurements from patients as healthy or Parkinson's; Banknote Authentication, which classifies pictures of currency as genuine or foraged; and Vertebral Column, which classifies biomedical data from patients as either normal or abnormal vertebral column. Each dataset is for a binary classification task, and each attribute is real-valued. For each dataset, the number of attributes ranges from 5 to 32 and the number of instances ranges from 197 to 1372. 

\subsection{Benchmark Algorithms}

We used five other algorithms for comparison to BoostEM to evaluate its performance. The following lists the algorithms' abbreviations as used in the graphs and discussion and describes them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{BoostEM}: our implementation of the BoostEM algorithm
\item \textbf{FullBoost}: applying the AdaBoost algorithm to the fully labeled dataset
\item \textbf{justBoost} applying the AdaBoost algorithm to the fraction of the labeled dataset
\item \textbf{justEM} applying Expectation Maximization to the fraction of the labeled dataset
\item \textbf{full\{Algorithm A\}} applying A to the fully labeled dataset without Boosting or EM
\item \textbf{just\{Algorithm A\}} applying A to the fraction of the labeled dataset without Boosting or EM
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodology}

We evaluated the aforementioned algorithms manipulating the following parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Dataset}: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic), Parkinsons, Banknote Authentication, Vertebral Column
\item \textbf{Learner}: ID3 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
\item \textbf{Fraction of Labeled Instances} 5\%, 20\%
\end{enumerate}

For each combination of these parameters, we averaged the resulting accuracies of five 10-fold cross validation runs. 

\subsection{Results}

 Among the six algorithms we ran cross validation for, we expected FullBoost to have the best average performance, JustAlg to
have the worst average performance, and the other four algorithms to perform in between. In general this intuition was found to be true about FullBoost.
FullBoost was the top performing algorithm in 15 of the 16 settings we tested, with a setting being a dataset/labeled fraction/base learner triple. The only algorithm to best it was BoostEM on the parkinsons data set
with 20\% labeled data. JustAlg, however, only performed worse than all other algorithms in 5 settings. JustBoost and EM were each the worst performing algorithm
in 5 settings.

Ideally, BoostEM would in general perform better than both JustBoost and EM since it is a generalization and combination of the two techniques. This is the case, 
with BoostEM improving over both EM and Boost in 9 settings, and performing better than EM in 15 settings, and better than justBoost in 10. In no instances is BoostEM 
the worst performing of the three algorithms.

Somewhat surprisingly, BoostEM with 20\% of the data also outperformed using all the data on the base learner in 6 out of the 8 settings we tested.  This would seem to imply our learner can outperform a traditional base learner while only using one fifth of the labeled data.

BoostEM also performs well when the amount of labeled data is decreased by a large amount (one fourth).  In most cases, BoostEM retains its accuracy better than Boost and comparably to EM.

In general it seems that fluctuations in average accuracy when BoostEM uses a different base learner is mostly due to the base learner in question, as accuracy changes by BoostEM are reflected in accuracy changes using only the base learner.
